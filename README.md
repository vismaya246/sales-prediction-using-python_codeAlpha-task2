Sales prediction using Python involves using machine learning techniques to forecast how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as advertising spend, target audience, and advertising platform.
 Typically, a product's sales are primarily dependent on how much you spend on advertising it, as the more people your product reaches, the more sales will increase as long as the quality of your product is good.
 In this context, Python is used to import necessary libraries and datasets, check for null values, and analyze the correlation between features before training a machine learning model.
 The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and using algorithms like linear regression to train a sales prediction model.
 The goal is to predict future sales, which helps businesses optimize stock levels, allocate resources, and plan marketing strategies
